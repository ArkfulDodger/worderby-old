# worderby
worderby is a competitive word game where players take turns finding words whose first letter(s) match the final letter(s) of the previously played word. Players earn points for each letter in their word, letters utilized from the previous word scoring more points than new letters added.

Players are challenged to find the highest scoring words they can while also trying to make it difficult for the other player to build off their choice.
